def convert(decimal_num):
    #I'll write a function named 'convert' and I'll pass an argument decimal_number. I'll convert this number into roman numeral. For sake of this project, you should be familiar with the coding a little bit. Your python knowledge is enough to solve this problem I thing. I'll use dictionary which has numbers as keys and their roman numbers as values. (the Roman numeral equivalent of this number)
    roman = {1000:'M', 900:'CM', 500:'D', 400:'CD', 100:'C', 90:'XC', 50:'L', 40:'XL', 10:'X', 9:'IX', 5:'V', 4:'IV', 1:'I'}
    # I create an empty string and it will hold my roman number
    num_to_roman = ''
    # I'll use for loop to create result. I'll divide the decimal number by dictionary keys from top to the end. I need to find out how many for example 1000 does decimal_num has. And then I'll multiply this number with value of key. 
    for i in roman.keys():
        num_to_roman += roman[i]*(decimal_num//i) # (decimal_num//i) gives us quotient of division
        # I need to get remainder of division of decimal_num by i
        decimal_num %= i
    return num_to_roman
    # Try a couple of examples. Of course, you all might have different functions
